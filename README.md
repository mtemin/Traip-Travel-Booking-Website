# Traip-Travel-Booking-Website
 In the bootcamp that “Techcareer.net” organised, i was a part of a 4 people group and we used a pre-designed Booking Website Template and used JavaScript with AngularJS Framework to complete the front-end of the website.  "Planning Your Holiday", "Amazing Tours Liked By The Adventurous" and Footer sections and modals, contact modal are made by me.
